  abstract  = {Are all film stars linked to Kevin Bacon? Why do the stock
               markets rise and fall sharply on the strength of a vague rumour?
               How does gossip spread so quickly? Are we all related through
               six degrees of separation? There is a growing awareness of the
               complex networks that pervade modern society. We see them in the
               rapid growth of the internet, the ease of global communication,
               the swift spread of news and information, and in the way
               epidemics and financial crises develop with startling speed and
               intensity. This introductory book on the new science of networks
               takes an interdisciplinary approach, using economics, sociology,
               computing, information science and applied mathematics to
               address fundamental questions about the links that connect us,
               and the ways that our decisions can have consequences for
               others.},
