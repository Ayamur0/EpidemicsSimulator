\section{Achieved Results}
In chapter \ref{cha:general_principles} the theory of epidemics was introduced. The two
main parts of epidemics were discussed, networks and diseases. Three existing models 
and their respective limitations were explained, a simple tree based model, the SIR Model
and the SIS Model. These were  combined and extended to create the custom model used in
this work. This custom model was explained in detail in section \ref{sec:custom_model}.

An app was created that uses the custom model to allow for simulations of epidemics. The
app contains functions to model social networks, create diseases with different models,
run simulations with the created networks and diseases and collect statistics about the
simulation. 
The general functionality of the app was outlined in chapter \ref{cha:implementation}
and its implementation is described in chapters \ref{cha:network_generation}, 
\ref{cha:network_display} and \ref{cha:visual_simulation} which
explain the process and algorithms involved in creating the app.

After creating the app some experiments were conducted to support the theories discussed in
chapter \ref{cha:general_principles}. These experiments were done using the developed app.
The results of the simulations coincided with the theories of how the diseases are 
expected to behave. This indicated the importance of factors like the reproductive number
$R_0$ in epidemics. The findings of these experiments and theories can be used to better
prepare for real world scenarios of epidemics. They help understand the behaviour of diseases
and their lifetimes in complex social networks.

\section{Outlook}
\subsection{Extensibility of the Results}
The network editor can be extended to allow for exact control which node is connected to which.
For this a solution is required that still allows for quick creation of large networks while
allowing such fine controls over the connections.

For very large networks the computation can take a long time. Tests showed that networks 
with \~100,000 nodes took almost 30 minutes to generate. One big factor for this long time
is that python is an interpreted language making such calculations relatively slow compared
to the same calculations in a language like C++. The app could be reimplemented in C++ which
would decrease the computing time but since C++ does not offer package like plotly a custom
implementation for displaying the graphs is necessary.

\subsection{Transferability of the Results}
The results achieved using the simulation can be transferred to real world scenarios.
These simulations can help to predict how an epidemic will evolve over time. This can
be used to test how certain factors affect the spreading of the disease to find out which
counter measures are necessary to suppres the disease and ensure the safety of the population.
One example could be reducing the amount of connections in the network which could be achieved
in the reald world by implementing measures for social distancing. Another factor that can be
tested if for example a vaccine that reduces the infection probability by a certain amount 
is sufficient to make the disease die out or what percenatage of people would need to be
vaccinated to achieve that.

Without tools to simulate the behaviours of diseases it is almost impossible to predict
what happens making it hard to decide on the necessary counter measure until it might be too late.
This is why tools for simulation are necessary in the field of epidemics.
